Increased emphasis on reproducibility in study design and statistical analysis has both prompted and necessitated national efforts to make large-scale data sources widely available. With nationally representative survey data available now more than ever, researchers can answer more complex scientific questions with improved generalizability and statistical precision. With the rise in interest in causal inference, a branch of statistics dedicated to understanding dynamic cause-and-effect mechanisms, there has been a corresponding shift in focus toward making causal statements using complex survey data.

Drawing causal conclusions from observational data requires careful considerations of both the appropriate quantity to estimate and the rigor of statistical methods to achieve this end. The `svyate` package introduces a novel strategy for incorporating sampling mechanisms such as survey weights in a statistically valid analysis to make causal statements when an individualâ€™s probability of selection depends on the treatment or characteristic of interest.


## Installation

You can install the development version of rPPI from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("awanafiaz/rPPI")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(rPPI)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.


In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
